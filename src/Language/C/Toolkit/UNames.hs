--- DESCRIPTION ---------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  Generates unqiue names according to a method of L. Augustsson, M. Rittri
--  & D. Synek ``Functional pearl: On generating unique names'', Journal of
--  Functional Programming 4(1), pp 117-123, 1994.
--
--  WARNING: DON'T tinker with the implementation!  It uses UNSAFE low-level 
--	     operations!
--
--- DOCU ----------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  language: Haskell 98
--
--  * This module provides an ordering relation on names (e.g., for using
--    `FiniteMaps'), but no assumption maybe made on the order in which names
--    are generated from the name space.  Furthermore, names are instances of
--    `Ix' to allow to use them as indicies.
--
--  * A supply should be used *at most* once to *either* split it or extract a 
--    stream of names.  A supply used repeatedly will always generate the same
--    set of names (otherwise, the whole thing wouldn't be referential
--    transparent).  
--
--  * If you ignored the warning below, looked at the implementation, and lost
--    faith, consider that laziness means call-by-need *and* sharing, and that
--    sharing is realized by updating evaluated thunks.
--
--  * ATTENTION: No clever CSE or unnecessary argument elimination may be
--    applied to the function `names'!

-- The initial supply (EXPORTED)
--
rootSupply :: NameSupply

rootSupply  = NameSupply (unsafeNewIntRef 1)

-- Split a name supply into a stream of supplies (EXPORTED)

-- Given a name supply, yield a stream of names (EXPORTED)
--
names                :: NameSupply -> [Name]
--
--  The recursion of `theNames' where `s' is passed as an argument is crucial, 
--  as it forces the creation of a new closure for `unsafeReadAndIncIntRef s'
--  in each recursion step.  Sharing a single closure or building a cyclic
--  graph for a nullary `theNames' would always result in the same name!  If
--  the compiler ever gets clever enough to optimize this, we have to prevent
--  it from doing so.

names (NameSupply s)  = 
  theNames s

    theNames s = Name (unsafeReadAndIncIntRef s) : theNames s
