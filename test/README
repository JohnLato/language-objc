= Test Framework =

== Build ==

> make

== Running roundtrip tests ==

> cd suite
> cp compile-lib.template run-my-lib.sh

Now edit run-my-lib.sh and change TESTNAME and the test directory.
Then either change the make target, or customize the build script.

== Rendering test results ==

In the default configuration:

> cd results
> ../bin/RenderTests parser-version list-of-test-names

for example

> ../bin/RenderTests parser-0.2 smoke glib gtk2

The result overview can be found in index.html.

== Running custom tests ==

Look at suite/run-smoke.sh

 * First the general setup:

> #!/bin/sh
> source ./configuration
> 
> export TESTNAME=my-test-name
> export CTEST_DEBUG=1                 # Set if you want debug messages
> 
> source $CTEST_BINDIR/setup_test_suite || { echo "Setup failed" 1>&2 ; exit 1 ; }

 * Run custom tests

> export CTEST_DRIVER=test-driver
> sh run-test test-args

Currently, only one test driver (CRoundTrip) is implemented.
