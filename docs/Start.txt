= Language.C - A C99 library for haskell =

The Language.C project aims to be a stable and compliant C99 library for [http://www.haskell.org haskell]. 

As for now, it features a complete, reasonably well tested parser and pretty printer for all of C99 and a large set of GNU extensions ([wiki:Cee C language support]).

Eventually, we also want to provide a complete analysis framework for C.
